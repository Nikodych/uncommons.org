        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p>
          In an ideal world, all your Watchmaker Framework questions would be answered by the documentation.  The world
          is not always ideal but this is still the first place you should look.  Try the
          <a href="/manual/index.html">user manual</a> and the Javadoc <a href="/api/index.html">API documentation</a>.
          If you find the documentation ambiguous, misleading or just plain wrong, please file a bug report
          (see below) and we will improve it.
        </p>
        <h2>Forum</h2>
        <p>
          If you can't find the answer to your question in the documentation, consider asking a question
          on the <a href="https://watchmaker.dev.java.net/servlets/ForumMessageList?forumID=2283">Watchmaker Framework
          forum</a> at Java.net.  The traffic is low but you should get a response to your query fairly promptly.
          You will need to be a <a href="https://www.dev.java.net/servlets/Join">registered Java.net user</a> in order
          to post on the forum.
        </p>
